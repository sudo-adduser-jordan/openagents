# Documentation map

This repository is edited by humans and by coding agents. Both need to know two
things quickly: which document describes a given concern, and which artifact is
the **source of truth** for it when documents disagree.

Open Agents's documentation has two layers. They grew organically; this page names them
so the split is intentional rather than incidental.

| Layer                     | Audience                      | Examples                                                        | How it stays correct                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Human-facing docs         | Contributors, users           | `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/`, https://orchestrator.inc/docs | Review. Prose describes code; it can lag behind it.     |
| Machine-readable contract | Coding agents, CI, generators | `openapi.yaml`, `AGENTS.md`, `skills/`, sqlc `gen/`             | Generated from source and/or checked by CI drift gates. |

The rule of thumb: **if an artifact in the contract layer disagrees with prose,
the contract layer wins**, because it is either generated from the code or gated
in CI. Fix the prose.

These documents explain intent and rationale. They are reviewed by people and
are not machine-checked, so treat them as the _why_ and confirm the _what_
against the contract layer below.

The CLI's hand-mirrored DTOs (`backend/internal/cli/`) are a deliberate manual
boundary: they are not generated from `openapi.yaml`, and wire compatibility is
covered by tests rather than a generator. See "API contract changes" in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## How to keep the layers in sync

- **Changing the daemon API**: edit `dto.go` and `build.go`, run `npm run api`,
  commit `openapi.yaml` and `schema.ts` with the Go change. CI fails otherwise.
- **Changing storage**: edit queries or add a migration, run `npm run sqlc`,
  commit `gen/`. Never hand-edit `gen/` or already-merged migrations.
- **Changing a hard rule or boundary**: update `AGENTS.md` in the same PR, and
  add an ADR under `docs/adr/` when the rule is a decision that needs rationale.
- **Changing `open-agents` CLI behavior**: update the command, its table test, and the
  matching page under `backend/internal/skillassets/using-open-agents/commands/`.
- **Changing prose only**: fine, but if the prose describes a contract artifact,
  re-read that artifact first. Prose follows the contract, not the reverse.

## Where to add new documentation

- A user needs it to use the product: https://orchestrator.inc/docs (source under
  `frontend/src/landing/content/docs/`).
- A contributor needs it to change the code: `docs/`, and add a row to
  [docs/README.md](README.md).
- An agent needs it to operate safely in the repo: `AGENTS.md`.
- An agent needs it to use the `open-agents` CLI at runtime: `backend/internal/skillassets/using-open-agents/`.
- It is a decision with trade-offs: `docs/adr/`.
