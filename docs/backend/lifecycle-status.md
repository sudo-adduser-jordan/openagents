# Lifecycle and status derivation

Display status is derived at read time by the service layer. Durable facts are the only persisted session state — see [overview.md](../overview.md).

## Status Derivation

### Display Status Precedence

The `service.Session` computes display status from durable facts using this precedence (highest to lowest):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    CheckTerm{is_terminated?}
    CheckTerm -->|Yes| PRMerged{PR merged?}
    CheckTerm -->|No| CheckWait{activity_state in<br/>waiting_input, blocked?}

    PRMerged -->|Yes| Merged[merged]
    PRMerged -->|No| Terminated[terminated]

    CheckWait -->|Yes| NeedsInput[needs_input]
    CheckWait -->|No| CheckPR{Has PR facts?}

    CheckPR -->|Yes| PRPipeline[PR Pipeline Check]
    CheckPR -->|No| CheckActive{activity_state<br/>== active?}

    PRPipeline --> PRState{PR State}
    PRState -->|ci failed| CIFailed[ci_failed]
    PRState -->|draft| Draft[draft]
    PRState -->|changes requested| Changes[changes_requested]
    PRState -->|not mergeable| Conflict[merge_conflict]
    PRState -->|mergeable| Mergeable[mergeable]
    PRState -->|approved| Approved[approved]
    PRState -->|review pending| ReviewPending[review_pending]
    PRState -->|open| PROpen[pr_open]

    CheckActive -->|Yes| Working[working]
    CheckActive -->|No| CheckSignal{Signal capable<br/>&& no signal?}

    CheckSignal -->|Yes| NoSignal[no_signal]
    CheckSignal -->|No| Idle[idle]

```

### PR Pipeline States

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    PR[Open PR] --> CI{CI Status}
    CI -->|failing| CIFailed[ci_failed]
    CI -->|pending| CIPending[ci_pending]
    CI -->|passing| Review{Reviews}

    Review -->|changes requested| Changes[changes_requested]
    Review -->|approved| Mergeable{Mergeable?}

    Mergeable -->|conflict| Conflict[merge_conflict]
    Mergeable -->|yes| Merged[Mergeable]

    PR -.->|draft| Draft[Draft State]

```

## Lifecycle Management

### Lifecycle Manager Responsibilities

The `lifecycle.Manager` is the **canonical write path** for all session lifecycle facts:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Inputs["Observation Inputs"]
        RuntimeObs[TUI Runtime Observations]
        ActivitySignals[Agent Activity Signals]
        ChatSignals[Chat Controller Signals]
        SCMObs[SCM Observations]
    end

    subgraph LCM["Lifecycle Manager"]
        Reducer[Fact Reducer]
        StateMachine[Activity State Machine]
        Termination[Termination Logic]
        Nudge[Agent Nudge Engine]
    end

    subgraph Outputs["Durable Facts"]
        ActivityState[activity_state]
        IsTerminated[is_terminated]
        PRFacts[PR Facts Table]
    end

    RuntimeObs --> Reducer
    ActivitySignals --> Reducer
    ChatSignals --> Reducer
    SCMObs --> Reducer

    Reducer --> StateMachine
    StateMachine --> Termination
    Termination --> ActivityState
    Termination --> IsTerminated

    SCMObs --> Nudge
    Nudge -->|route| Agent[Agent Adapter]

```

### Session State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Spawning: Spawn()
    Spawning --> Active: MarkSpawned
    Active --> Idle: activity_state = idle
    Active --> Working: activity_state = active
    Active --> Waiting: activity_state = waiting_input / blocked
    Active --> Exited: activity_state = exited
    Working --> Active: work completes
    Waiting --> Active: user responds
    Idle --> Active: agent starts work
    Exited --> Terminated: process exit
    Active --> Terminated: Kill()
    Waiting --> Terminated: Kill()
    Idle --> Terminated: Kill()
    Terminated --> [*]

    note right of Active
        Agent is working
        TUI runtime or Chat controller alive
    end note

    note right of Waiting
        Agent needs input
        Waiting for user
    end note

    note right of Terminated
        Session over
        Mode-owned controller cleaned up
    end note
```

### Termination Guardrails

The lifecycle manager only terminates when **all** conditions are met:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Check{Can terminate?}
    Check -->|No| Keep[Keep running]

    Check -->|Yes| AllDead{Runtime AND<br/>process dead?}
    AllDead -->|No| Keep
    AllDead -->|Yes| NoRecent{No recent<br/>activity?}
    NoRecent -->|No| Keep
    NoRecent -->|Yes| NoPR{No merged PR<br/>ownership?}
    NoPR -->|No| Keep
    NoPR -->|Yes| Terminate[Mark terminated]

    Terminate --> Cleanup[Trigger cleanup]
    Cleanup --> CDC[CDC event]
    CDC --> UI[Dashboard update]

```

**Key principle:** Failed probes are NOT proof of death. A session is only terminated when the runtime and process are **both** clearly dead and recent activity doesn't contradict that.
