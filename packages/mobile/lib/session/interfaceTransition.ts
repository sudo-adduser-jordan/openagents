 * How many consecutive failures a poll with nothing in flight will absorb
 * before it gives up.
 *
 * The two waits this scheduler serves are not the same shape, so they do not
 * share a retry policy. A live handoff is a real operation with a banner on
 * screen: it retries until the link returns, because a blanket cap stranded one
 * behind any outage longer than the budget — once the last timer had fired,
 * connectivity returning changed nothing and the banner froze until the screen
 * was remounted (#4852 review). A readiness wait is speculative: #4122 says it
 * may never clear even on a healthy link, which is why it was given a budget at
 * all, and against a daemon that never answers it cannot make progress by
 * waiting longer. The same goes for a mount fetch that never landed.
 *
 * Five is five requests with 1+2+4+8s between them, the fifth failure being
 * the one that stops it: about 15s against a refused connection, and about 75s
 * when every request burns REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS instead of answering. Past it the
 * escape is the header recheck, tappable precisely because no transition is
 * live, and any request that lands clears the count and restarts this loop.
 *
 * A spent count survives backgrounding, like the readiness window and for the
 * same reason: `appActive` re-runs the effect, so anything the effect owned
 * would make app-switching the way to refill a budget. Returning to the app is
 * news about the user, not about the link.
 *
 * This never competes with the 401 stop, which foregrounding does give one
 * fresh request: a rejection is a request that landed, so `refresh` clears the
 * count rather than spending it, and `pollable` owns that stop on its own.

 * paid for out of the readiness window. `failureStatus` is the HTTP status of
 * the latest failure, `undefined` when nothing answered.
 *
 * Retrying on failure with no status at all is deliberate: a first fetch that
 * never landed would otherwise leave the screen with no poll to start, and the
 * switch would stay greyed out for the life of the screen. That retry is
 * bounded like the readiness wait — see speculativeFailureAttempts — because
 * there is no operation in flight to keep it alive indefinitely.
