 *
 * Every action here maps to an endpoint that actually exists. That constraint
 * is the whole design: the obvious missing item is "Stop", and there is no stop
 * or pause endpoint. `killSession` is what Delete already calls, and its own
 * copy says it terminates the session — so a "Stop" entry would be a second,
 * gentler-sounding name for the same destructive call. Resume/Restore are the
 * honest inverses instead.
