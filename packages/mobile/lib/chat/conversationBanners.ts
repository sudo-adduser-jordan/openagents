/**
 * Words for the status bars above a conversation, shaped like the desktop's
 * `ChatStatusBanners`: a short headline that says what is wrong, and at most one
 * quiet line of detail. The provider's raw error text is left out — on a phone
 * it was a paragraph that pushed the conversation off screen.
 *
 * Every banner carries a `key` built from what it is reporting. Closing a banner
 * hides that key for the visit; when the underlying state changes — another
 * server fails, the quota crosses into critical — the key changes and the banner
 * comes back, because that is news.
