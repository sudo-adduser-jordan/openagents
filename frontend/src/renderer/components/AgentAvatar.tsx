 * Agent mark for board/task cards: the harness's real brand logo rendered bare —
 * no tile, border, or background — so each brand's own shape shows agents
 * carrying their own rounded background. Agents without an asset fall back to a
 * bare initial. Kept small so the title stays the hero.
 *
 * The provider is exposed as the accessible name (alt / aria-label), not just a
 * hover title, so surfaces that show the logo in place of visible agent text —
 * e.g. the archive cards — still name the agent for screen readers.
