## Subcommands

### open-agents review submit

Record a reviewer's result for a worker's PR.

**Syntax:**
```
open-agents review submit [worker-session-id] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Meaning | Default / Required |
|---|---|---|
| `--body string` | Review body: a path to a Markdown file, or `-` to read from stdin | - |
| `--review-id string` | Id of the GitHub PR review just posted (the `.id` from the `gh api` POST that created the review) | - |
| `--reviews string` | JSON review results array or object: a path, or `-` to read from stdin | - |
| `--run string` | Review run id | Required |
| `--session string` | Worker session id (or pass it as the positional argument) | - |
| `--verdict string` | Review verdict: `approved` or `changes_requested` | Required |

If the local daemon is restarting when a result is submitted, Open Agents retains the
parsed result in memory and retries the same idempotent request for up to 30
seconds. Validation errors return immediately. If the daemon remains unavailable,
the command reports failure and can be repeated safely; daemon idempotency
handles the case where an earlier connection dropped after committing the result.

## Examples

```bash
# Submit an approved review for session mer-3
open-agents review submit mer-3 --run review-run-1 --verdict approved
```

```bash
# Submit a changes-requested review with a body from stdin
echo "Please fix the null check on line 42." | open-agents review submit --session mer-3 --run review-run-1 --verdict changes_requested --body -
```
