// WorkflowMode is the user-controlled delivery stage of a session: where its
// work sits between task creation and merge. Unlike SessionMode (which
// conversation controller runs the session), WorkflowMode is a board
// placement: a session is "planning" until a user (or a build-mode
// orchestrator) pushes it into "building".
//
//   - WorkflowModePlanning: the session is being scoped/designed before work
//     starts. This is the default for every new task; the board shows it in the
//     Planning lane.
//   - WorkflowModeBuilding: the session is executing — writing code, opening
//     PRs, and moving through review to merge. The board shows it in the
//     Building lane (then Review and Ready as PR facts arrive).
