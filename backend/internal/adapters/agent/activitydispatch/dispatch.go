// agent's hook callbacks as an Open Agents activity state.

// The hidden `open-agents hooks` CLI command dispatches a live callback through it. Every

// registered here — otherwise the adapter writes callbacks that nothing on the
// receiving side understands, so its activity is silently never reported.
