// Worktree removal races process exit on Windows. A PTY (or any agent child)
// rooted in the worktree can still hold a handle on that directory for a short
// window AFTER the call that killed it returned — the OS releases handles
// asynchronously during process teardown, and the process is already gone from
// every liveness probe by then. os.RemoveAll fails with
// ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION / ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED ("The process cannot access the
// file because it is being used by another process"), even though nothing is
// meaningfully using the directory anymore and a retry a moment later succeeds.
//
// This is reachable from `open-agents session kill` on a session whose scoped shell
// terminals were just destroyed: Session Manager closes the shells, then
// removes the worktree immediately, inside the same request. Measured release
// latency ran past a second with two shells open, so the budget below is
// deliberately generous — a kill that takes a few extra seconds is strictly
// better than one that 500s and strands the worktree.
//
// These are vars, not consts, so tests can drive the loop without sleeping for
// real.

	// measured behaviour — a two-shell session was observed still holding its
	// worktree past the 5s mark — with headroom on top, since the alternative
	// to waiting is a failed kill that strands the worktree. Finite so a
	// genuinely wedged directory still surfaces as an error rather than
	// hanging the request forever.
	//
	// This budget is per PATH, and Session Manager removes a workspace
	// project's repos one at a time while holding that session's shell-terminal
	// gate, so N repos can serialize into N × this. Keep it comfortably under
	// shellterm's sessionGateWaitTimeout ÷ a realistic repo count, or a slow
	// teardown starts turning concurrent opens into gate-busy 409s. Honouring
	// ctx below is what keeps that bounded in practice: a caller that gives up
	// stops the whole chain rather than paying every repo's budget in turn.

// budget carries errRemoveRetryExhausted while preserving the underlying error.
//
// Retries stop early when ctx is done: time.Sleep is uninterruptible, so

// deadline passed) would still pay out the remaining budget — and with a
// workspace project's repos torn down serially, several of them in a row.
